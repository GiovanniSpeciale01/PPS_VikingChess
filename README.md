You can navigate through all moves of the match and undo the last move whenever you want during a match.

Now the last move is highlighted.

You can play hnefatafl in 4 variants in pvp offline and pve:

- hnefatafl 11x11
- tawlbwrdd 11x11
- tablut 9x9
- brandubh 9x9

With multiple sandwich captures, different dispositions and different ways to take the white king.

In pve mode you can play against two different difficulties:

- Newcomer: very easy difficulty
- Amateur: easy difficulty, still slow

You can open the in game menu whenever you want during a match and select what to do:

- continue the match
- restart the match
- leave the match and start another one (or close the game)
